Cloud computing is a computing model enabling ubiquitous network access to a shared and virtualised pool of computing capabilities (e.g., network, storage, processing, and memory) that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort. The landscape of cloud computing encompasses a multitude of cloud providers, as well as several infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions. The ability to run and manage multi-cloud systems (i.e., applications targeting multiple private, public, or hybrid clouds) allows exploiting the peculiarities of each cloud solution and hence optimising performance, availability, and cost of the applications. However, these cloud solutions are typically heterogeneous and the provided features are often incompatible. This diversity hinders the proper exploitation of the full potential of cloud computing, since it prevents interoperability and promotes vendor lock-in, as well as it increases the complexity of development and administration of multi-cloud systems. This challenge needs to be addressed promptly.

There are several projects that aim at addressing this challenge by providing solutions for provisioning, deployment, monitoring and adaptation of cloud systems. The results from these projects are paramountly important to promote interoperability and prevent vendor lock-in, but they are not sufficient to properly manage the complexity of development and administration of multi-cloud systems.

CloudML tames this complexity by providing a domain-specific modelling language along with a run-time environment that facilitate the specification of provisioning, deployment, and adaptation concerns of multi-cloud systems at design-time and their enactment at run-time.
